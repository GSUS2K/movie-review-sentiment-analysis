# Movie Review Sentiment Classification using NLP and Machine Learning

A Python data science project that performs sentiment classification on IMDb movie reviews using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The model predicts whether a movie review is **positive** or **negative** based on the review text.

This project also includes feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, supervised learning, unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering, dimensionality reduction using TruncatedSVD, and model persistence using Joblib.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **IMDb Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews**.

Dataset source:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews

The original dataset contains two columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `review` | Text content of the movie review |
| `sentiment` | Sentiment label: positive or negative |

> Note: The dataset file is not included in this GitHub repository because the `dataset/` folder is ignored using `.gitignore`.  
> To run the project, download the dataset manually from Kaggle and place the CSV file inside the `dataset/` folder.

Expected dataset path:

```text
dataset/IMDB Dataset.csv
```

## Engineered Features

The following additional columns were created from the review text:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `character_count` | Total number of characters in the review |

## Text Preprocessing

The review text was cleaned using the following steps:

- Converted text to lowercase.
- Removed HTML tags.
- Removed URLs.
- Removed numbers and special characters.
- Removed stopwords.
- Removed common movie-related words.
- Applied lemmatization.
- Created a cleaned review column.

Lemmatization was used instead of stemming so that words remain readable and meaningful. For example, words like `excellent`, `beautiful`, and `terrible` remain understandable instead of being shortened into incomplete root forms.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The project includes the following EDA tasks:

- Sentiment distribution analysis
- Review length distribution
- Average review length by sentiment
- Character count comparison
- Word count comparison
- Exclamation count comparison
- Correlation heatmap of engineered features
- Positive review word cloud
- Negative review word cloud
- Top positive sentiment words
- Top negative sentiment words

---

## Model Building

The cleaned review text was converted into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization**. The transformed data was then used to train multiple machine learning models.

The models used were:

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Naive Bayes | Baseline model for text classification |
| Logistic Regression | Linear model for binary classification |
| Linear SVM | Suitable for high-dimensional text data |
| KNN | Distance-based classification model |

A Scikit-learn pipeline was also created to combine TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression into a single reusable workflow.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GSUS2K/movie-review-sentiment-analysis.git
```

### 2. Open the Project Folder

```bash
cd movie-review-sentiment-analysis
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download the Dataset

The dataset is not included in this repository because the `dataset/` folder is ignored using `.gitignore`.

Download the dataset from Kaggle:

```text
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews
```

After downloading, create a folder named `dataset` in the project root.

Your folder structure should look like this:

```text
movie-review-sentiment-analysis/
│
├── dataset/
│   └── IMDB Dataset.csv
│
├── notebook/
│   └── movie_sentiment_project.ipynb
│
├── outputs/
├── models/
├── report/
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── .gitignore
```

The dataset file must be placed exactly here:

```text
dataset/IMDB Dataset.csv
```

### 5. Open Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### 6. Run the Notebook

Open the notebook:

```text
notebook/movie_sentiment_project.ipynb
```

Then run all cells from top to bottom.

### 7. Generated Files

After running the notebook, the following files will be generated:

```text
outputs/enhanced_imdb_reviews.csv
models/movie_sentiment_pipeline.pkl
```

The `enhanced_imdb_reviews.csv` file contains the cleaned and feature-engineered dataset.

The `movie_sentiment_pipeline.pkl` file contains the saved machine learning pipeline.

### Note

If the `outputs/` or `models/` folders do not exist after cloning, create them manually before running the notebook:

```bash
mkdir outputs models
```

---

## Model Persistence

The final machine learning pipeline was saved using Joblib:

```python
joblib.dump(sentiment_pipeline, "../models/movie_sentiment_pipeline.pkl")
```

The saved model can be loaded later and used for predicting the sentiment of new movie reviews.

---

## Results

The project successfully demonstrates:

- Text preprocessing using NLP
- Feature engineering from review text
- Exploratory data analysis using visualizations
- Sentiment classification using supervised machine learning
- Model comparison using evaluation metrics
- Review clustering using K-Means
- Cluster visualization using TruncatedSVD
- Model saving using Joblib

The best-performing model can be selected based on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score values obtained in the notebook.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete Python data science workflow for NLP-based sentiment classification. The original IMDb dataset contained only two columns, but additional features were generated using feature engineering. The review text was cleaned, transformed using TF-IDF, and classified using machine learning models.

Supervised models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, and KNN were used for sentiment classification. K-Means clustering was also applied for unsupervised learning, and TruncatedSVD was used for two-dimensional cluster visualization.

This project covers important concepts such as data cleaning, data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, visualization, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, pipeline creation, model evaluation, and model persistence.

## Future Scope

- Use deep learning models such as LSTM or BERT.
- Add neutral sentiment classification.
- Deploy the model as a web application using Streamlit.
- Use recent reviews from OTT platforms or movie review websites.
- Improve clustering using advanced sentence embeddings.
- Add multilingual sentiment analysis.
